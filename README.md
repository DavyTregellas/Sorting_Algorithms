This program I created to compare the speed of sorting algorithms.

This program allows the user to select how many randomly generated numbers are in the array that needs sorting.
The user can also decided on the number of 'runs' this is how many diffrent arrays are generated for the algorithm.
When this is decided the users can chooses in the main which sorting algorithm to uses and the sorting is timed.

I used this program to compare the efficiency of sorting algorithms as the size of the array increased.
